# Funny Jokes
- We were challenged with building whatever application came to mind that had a client UI which communicated with an API.

- [User Client](https://github.com/grconnor/funny_jokes_client_team_2)
- [API](https://github.com/grconnor/funny_jokes_api_team_2)

## Team:

## Getting started
### Necessary steps:

```
$ bundle install
```

### Start rspec:

```
$ rspec spec/resquests/api/v1/admin/journalist_can_create_articles_spec.rb
```

### Start the rails server locally:

```
$ rails s
```

## Updates/Improvements

-

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

First user story:

Api gets a random joke from external Api and returns it 

As an API
in order to return a random joke
I'd need to fetch a random joke from external API

API makes a get request to " Joke"
API returns response

Done
